I have foot problems, so it is hard to find shoes that I can wear all day.  After being on a treadmill for an hour, I put these on for the rest of the day and went shopping, and was on my feet all day with the Grandkids, my feet never bothered me. 
This is what I was expecting since I wear a different style of Hobibear as a house shoe and have never had problems.  I wear Chaco in the summer, but start to have problems when winter comes and I have to start wearing real shoes. 
I have spent a lot of money on good brands and still have problems, so I am delighted that Hobibear has shoes I can wear outside the house. 
I am a little worried about getting them wet, but I guess I'll deal with that when the time comes.  I will probably be buying another pair for outdoors again soon.  Best shoe I have found for all around comfort and support!
One of the best-fitting, and most comfortable shoes ever made. I will be purchasing more in other colors.
I bought this for my son, who lives in the North Dakota area.  He's 5'3" and 175lbs, which are perfect for him.  He wears a size 7 and a size 8.  I ordered a size 8 and the fit is perfect.  He's tall and has a narrow foot, which is good.  He likes that the shoes are made from a very soft material, which is great.  He's very comfortable with them.  He's a huge fan of the suede that he's worn at the gym
Love these shoes. If you're looking for the best looking shoes for your petite, this is the shoe for you.  The comfort, durability and style are top notch.  I love that they are made in China. 
I'm very pleased. I bought these for my mom who is a nurse and she loves them. She has a lot of work
This is one of 3 pair of shoes I've purchased in the past 2 years. They are so comfortable and comfortable. I have bought a pair of black and white and they are still good quality. 
I wish I had gotten the two in black and white.  I have a wide foot and I can wear the white pair without shoes.  They are very comfortable.  I wear them all the time and they are a perfect size for me.  I have had them for a couple of years and they are comfortable.
I've worn them a lot and have had no complaints. I will keep them for the next couple of years.I had to return them because they were too small, so I ordered a larger size. I still wear them, but they were too small. I returned them.
Great shoe. They fit great. I ordered them in the same size as I received them. They are very comfortable. I highly recommend these shoes.
I love these shoes. I have been wearing them for years. I'm going to order a second pair in different colors.
Comfortable shoes, perfect for all-day wear. No foot issues after hours on a treadmill and a day with grandkids.
Hobibear shoes are a game-changer for those with foot problems. Delighted to find a comfortable option for outdoor use.
Chaco is my go-to in summer, but Hobibear is the winter savior. No more problems when transitioning to real shoes.
Tried various expensive brands, but Hobibear is the winner for overall comfort and support.
Concerned about getting them wet, but the comfort outweighs the worry. Likely buying another pair for outdoor activities.
Best-fitting and most comfortable shoes ever. Planning to purchase more in different colors.
